Female receptacle is 8.5mm long, with 4.04mm from base of receptacle to edge of far wire, or 3.53mm to center of wire.
Male pin is 6mm long, with 2.5mm deep base, 1.2mm to edge of first wire (1.71mm to center)
Thus, the far wires end up (8.5+3.53)+(2.5+1.71)=16.24mm apart.
The furthest apart the boards can be mounted with a 2mm border is a 16.24mm-2*(2mm+2.54mm)=7.16mm gap.
- To maintain spacing of 13.05mm, jumpers should have their wire 1.59mm "inward" of the LED centerpoint
- To maintain spacing of 13.45mm, jumpers should be 1.39mm "inward"


For LEDs with a 6mmx6mm footprint (5x5 rounded up). Fitting 8 from edge to edge gives a spacing of (100mm-8*6mm)/8=6.5mm, or 12.5mm center-to-center.
With a 7.3mmx5.5mm LED spaced 13mm center-to-center, the board needs to be 7.3*8+(13-7.3)*7=98.3mm on the long side
  and 5.5*8+(13-5.5)*7=96.5mm on the short side.
